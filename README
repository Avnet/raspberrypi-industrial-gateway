Linux kernel
============

This is the kernel source tree for the IIoTGateway.

We use the cross compiler cross-gcc-8.3.0-pi_2-3 tool chain.  Any other suitable cross compiler for the ARM may be used.

To compile the kernel use the following.

make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-

The image is found in arch/arm/boot/zImage it should be copied to /boot/zImage on the gateway.
